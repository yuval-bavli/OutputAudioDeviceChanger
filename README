OutputAudioDeviceChanger:

FOR WINDOWS ONLY

Written in C#.

This project is created in order to allow you to easily change the default output audio device (instead of using the windows GUI).

The application would start in the tray notification bar and will contain a context menu that will let you change the default output audio device.

NOTE:
The core API of this program was taken from another open source project: https://github.com/hirekoke/CoreAudioApi
This project adds a GUI for it and simplifies the interface.
